# us_states_game
Name all 50 states of US


## How does it work: 

Type all US States Names you remember of within the prompt.

The State Name you filled will appear on the corresponding place on the map.

Type 'Exit' within the prompt if you can't remember them all. A csv file will be generated with all the states you missed, which will allow you to focus on the state you coudn't remember.
